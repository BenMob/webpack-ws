## Instroduction To [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

In this workshop you will learn how to bundle an entire front end application using webpack. Modern front end frameworks such as React, Vue and Angular use similar techniques under the hood to turn large scale front end applications into a minified set of files that can be easily understood by the browser.  You will learn concepts such as webpack's entry, output, loaders and plugins.
