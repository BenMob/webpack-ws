## Instroduction To [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

In this workshop you will learn how to bundle an entire front end application using webpack. Modern front end frameworks such as React, Vue and Angular use similar techniques under the hood to turn large scale front end applications into a minified set of files that can be easily understood by the browser.  You will learn concepts such as webpack's entry, output, loaders and plugins.

### Setup

After cloning the repository run the command `npm install`, and you will see a `node_modules` appear. To start the app locally, run the command `npm start`
If everything works properly, you should see the game running in your browser. To bundle the application using webpack, run the command `npm run build` and you will see a build folder created with your static files in it.
